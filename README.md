## 🚀 Overview
**KeyStroke** is a standalone utility that displays your currently pressed keys in a sleek, non-intrusive overlay on your screen. 

Whether you are a teacher conducting a coding workshop, a YouTuber recording a software tutorial, or a streamer showing off gaming mechanics, KeyStroke ensures your audience never misses a beat. It is designed to be **minimalist yet powerful**, fading away when not in use and intelligently handling complex key combinations.

## ✨ Key Features
* **🎯 Smart Visualization:** Automatically detects and formats shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl + C`, `Shift + Alt + Del`).
* **🖥️ Multi-Monitor Support:** Choose exactly which screen the overlay appears on—perfect for dual-monitor setups.
* **🧠 Intelligent Filtering:** Option to "Only show combined keys" to keep the screen clean (hides normal typing, shows shortcuts only).
* **🎨 Smooth Animations:** Features elegant fade-in/out effects to minimize distraction.
* **⚡ Anti-Ghosting:** Prevents spamming visual noise when holding down a key (ignores auto-repeat).
* **🛠️ Highly Configurable:** Toggle display for specific groups like:
    * Arrow Keys
    * Numpad
    * Function Keys
    * OEM Keys (`{ } \ ; '`)
    * Windows Key (`❖`)
